    <title>What is crafting</title>
    <conbody>
        <p><i>Crafting</i> in Path of Exile means changing an existing item's characteristics to create an item that otherwise does not exist in the game. </p>
        <p><b>NOTE: </b>Although the crafting goal is to create a better item, the process is random, and the outcome is <u>not guaranteed</u>. Usually obtaining a high-end game item requires multiple crafting attempts.</p>
