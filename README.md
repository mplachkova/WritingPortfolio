# Writing examples

This is a collection of technical document samples to demonstrate my document writing skills. I don't have work experience with software documentation writing so decided to write about some applications I like, and use on daily basis.

Documents here are created on the base of my own experience as a user and only with training purpose. They are not in any way related to the official applications documentation and I don't have any relation with the teams or organizations which created these applications. If you are interested in some of the products mentioned here please visit their official websites.
