# Reference documentation

## About

This document is my solution for the final exercise from the **Learn API Technical Writing 2: REST for Writers** course. It includes documenting POST and GET requests for a fictitious dating service platform.

This document doesn't have Authorization section nor it's planned to have one in the future. The note in the Value filed is just added as it would be described in a real document.
